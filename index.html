      <p class="mb5">To deliver a fully functional proof of concept to collect and visualize ideas within 5 days, just in time for the <a href="http://www.climatehub.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Climate Week (NYC)</a> event.</p>

      <hr class="thin mt0 mb5">

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb4">Vulnerable areas of our planet might be in danger if we fail to peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 affecting the lives of billions of people.</p>

      <img src="assets/2020-Wordmark.png" class="w-50 mb4" alt="2020 Wordmark">

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb3"><a href="http://www.mission2020.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mission 2020</a> is a new type of collaborative venture that is bringing together institutions, governments and the private sector to achieve peaking of global emissions by 2020. Because the imperative to peak by 2020 has not been widely understood, Mission 2020 is working on two priority areas: <strong>raising awareness</strong> so that there is an urgency for change and <strong>generating the conditions for action.</strong></p>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb3">In this context, Mission 2020, alongside the 71st Session of the United Nations General Assembly and in support of <strong>Climate Week 2016</strong>, was hosting the Climate Action Strategy Hub, to serve as a physical landing space for individuals and organization across the broad spectrum of the climate movement.</p>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb3">On Tuesday the 13th of September (-6 days before the event kick-off), we were approached by Systemiq and Mission 2020. They were looking for a bespoke interactive digital platform to do the following:</p>

      <ul class="dashed list lh-copy pl5-ns ph3 mt0 mb3">
        <li class="pl4-ns">A visualisation tool to project onto a wall</li>
        <li class="pl4-ns">To have ideas added live via an app</li>
        <li class="pl4-ns">To interact with the ideas (comment and vote)</li>
        <li class="pl4-ns">To visualize ideas in bubbles and make the bubbles grow based on the number of votes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb3">And a small detail ... it needed to be ready by Sunday at the latest.</p>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb3">Our first reaction to the brief was: &ldquo;It looks too tight, we will not make it&rdquo;. We had less than 3 hours to come back to the client to evaluate if it was feasible and accept or reject the challenge.</p>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb3">After discussing with our Engineering team we decided to take the risk.</p>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb5">On Wednesday (- 5 days to go) we had a meeting in London to discuss the details and validate precisely the requirements. We bring a rough storyboard to help visualize the project.</p>

      <figcaption class="f7 lh-copy tracked gray mb5">Storyboard used to validate the proof of concept</figcaption>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb3">Due to time pressure, it was time to discuss alternatives (in case we were unable to deliver) and core features (&ldquo;What could be the minimum acceptable product?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Which features could wait?&rdquo;)</p>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb3">Once the requirements were understood and agreed, we started immediately, there was no time to lose.</p>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb5">By Thursday we had the wireframes of the application ready and the backend was ready on Friday. Our UI designer started on Saturday (ideally he should have started at the beginning) and started working on the Visualization.</p>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb0 mb5">By Saturday also the web app to submit and interact with the ideas was ready to test. We spent the weekend testing, reporting and correcting bugs, collaborating using a Trello Board.</p>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb4">By Monday (-14 hours to go, the time difference with NYC play in favour) we were ready!</p>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb5">During the week, and using again the time difference, we managed to deploy the new app layout.</p>

      <blockquote class="f3 i tracked mt0 mb5 mh0 pl4 bbl">
        &ldquo;I believe it has a lot of potential and could, as an app, serve many needs, potentially the core 200-300 working in strategic positions in the climate action landscape or potentially servicing hundreds of thousands of people, and maybe more, who are more broadly committed to the Mission 2020 challenge.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>

      <p class="ph5-ns ph3 mb5">Our app helped M2020 to validate the concept and gather feedback from the participants during the week.</p>

      <blockquote class="f3 i tracked mt0 mb5 mh0 pl4 bbl">
        &ldquo;We did receive valuable ideas and made important connections on how such a tool could be used to service the landscape by aggregating analytical material in powerful ways (including around key countries, companies, investors/parts of the finance system, and sub national entities).&rdquo;
